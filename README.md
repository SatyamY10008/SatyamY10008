<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
I am a final-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a strong interest in data analytics and data-driven decision making. I have hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to analyze raw and semi-structured datasets, uncover meaningful patterns, and translate insights into actionable outcomes.<br><br>

Through internships and academic projects, I have worked on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, KPI tracking, dashboard development, and reporting to support both AI-driven product research and social-impact initiatives. I enjoy working with real-world data and building analytical solutions that create measurable impact.<br><br>

✨ Career Goals ✨<br>
🎯 Short-term: Start my career as a Data Analyst or Analytics Associate, strengthen my skills in advanced SQL, Power BI, and statistical analysis, and contribute to analytics-focused projects and open datasets.<br><br>

🎯 Long-term: Grow into a Data Scientist or Analytics Consultant role, work on business, product, or impact-driven analytics at scale, and help organizations make smarter decisions through data.
