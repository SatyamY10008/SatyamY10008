<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I am an Embedded Systems Engineer with 2+ years of hands-on experience in designing and programming real-time robotic systems. My expertise spans microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP32, STM32), sensor integration, PCB design, and firmware development in Embedded C/C++. I have built IoT-enabled humanoid robots and educational robotics kits, leveraging communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C. Passionate about automation and real-time control, I thrive on solving complex problems in robotics and IoT through innovative hardware-software solutions. My work includes deploying systems with RTOS, ROS, and MATLAB modeling, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications in embedded technologies.<br><br><br>âœ¨ Goals in Career âœ¨<br>ðŸŽ¯ Short-term: Enhance my proficiency in Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and Robot Operating System (ROS) to develop more scalable and efficient robotic solutions. Contribute to open-source embedded projects and publish technical blogs to share knowledge.<br><br>ðŸŽ¯ Long-term: Lead a team in designing cutting-edge embedded systems for industrial automation or autonomous vehicles. Innovate in IoT-enabled robotics to create sustainable, smart technologies that address real-world challenges in agriculture, healthcare, or education.</p>
